# ML-Model-for-Price-Prediction
MACHINE LEARNING ADVENTURE SERIES

The model I have tried is **Decision Tree Regressor, Random Tree Regressor and Support Vector Regression (From SVM)

Building a Machine Learning model of housing prices in a state using California Census data.
Objective: To output a prediction of a district's median housing price. (District comprises 600-3000 people in the area)
Solution: A supervised learning task, a multiple univariate regression problem using batch learning process as data is old.
Python Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

I will go through various steps required to build a ML model from scratch.
1. Framing the problem by looking at the big picture
2. Get the Data
3. Visualise data to gain insights and discover trends and anomalies
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine tune my model
7. Present my solution
8. Pending-- Launch my model with a visual interface using cloud
